The primary development goal is to implement a functional shooting game using a programming language of C++ and relevant data structure. Key features include user input handling, random enemy obstacle generation, player spaceship movement mechanics, collision detection, and scoring system.
Learning Outcomes.<br/>
Enhanced Team Collaboration and Communication Skills. Developing problem-solving skills through game development. Implementing basic algorithms for collision detection and score tracking. Gaining experience in user input handling and game mechanics.

## Description
Space Shooter is a 2d game developed using C++. The player takes control of a spaceship and the goal is to defeat the enemies while avoiding the bullets fired by them. Each time the player hits enemies with a bullet, the player's score increases by 50 points.The movements of the enemies get faster gradually <br/>
